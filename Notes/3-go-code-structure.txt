ðŸ§  Line-by-Line Breakdown
--------------------------

ðŸ”¹ package main
Think of package like a folder or a group of files that work together.

main is a special package in Go that tells the Go compiler:

"This is where the program starts. Run from here!"

âœ… So any file that starts with package main is saying,
ðŸ‘‰ "I'm the main entry point â€” run me like an app!"


ðŸ”¹ import "fmt"

You're importing a helper toolkit from Goâ€™s standard library.

fmt stands for "formatting" â€” it's a built-in Go package.

It helps you print text, format strings, show numbers, and more.

âœ… Youâ€™re telling Go:
ðŸ‘‰ "Hey, I want to use the tools from the fmt package â€” bring them in."


ðŸ”¹ func main() { ... }

func means "function" â€” basically, a block of code that does something.

main() is a special function that Go runs first when you execute the program.

âœ… Itâ€™s like saying:
ðŸ‘‰ "Start here when running the program!"


ðŸ”¹ fmt.Println("Hello world")

Youâ€™re using the fmt package to print text to the screen.

Println means "Print line" â€” it prints and moves to the next line.

âœ… So this line simply does:
ðŸ‘‰ "Print: Hello world"
