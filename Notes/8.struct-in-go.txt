🧱 What is a struct in Go?
---------------------------

A struct (short for “structure”) is like a blueprint or a box where you can group different pieces of data (called fields) that belong together.

In other languages like Java or C#, it's kinda like a class with only variables — no methods (unless you attach them later).

🧒 Real-Life Analogy
-----------------------

Let’s say you're describing a Person. A person has:

a name (string)

an age (int)

a job title (string)

Instead of keeping 3 separate variables, you can just make a struct to hold all of them in one place!

Example:

package main

import "fmt"

// Step 1: Create a struct
type Person struct {
    name     string
    age      int
    jobTitle string
}

func main() {
    // Step 2: Create a value of that struct
    var p1 Person
    p1.name = "Eliana"
    p1.age = 25
    p1.jobTitle = "Software Engineer"

    fmt.Println("Name:", p1.name)
    fmt.Println("Age:", p1.age)
    fmt.Println("Job Title:", p1.jobTitle)
}

🛠️ Alternate (and cooler) way to assign values
-----------------------------------------------

You can also use shorthand syntax when creating a struct:

p2 := Person{name: "Vivienne", age: 22, jobTitle: "Data Analyst"}
fmt.Println(p2)

🕵️ Accessing values
---------------------

Just use dot . notation like:

p2.name     // "Vivienne"
p2.age      // 22

🔍 Can structs be inside other structs?
-----------------------------------------

Heck yes! Like this:

type Address struct {
    city    string
    country string
}

type Employee struct {
    name    string
    age     int
    address Address
}

Then:

emp := Employee{
    name: "Elly",
    age:  28,
    address: Address{
        city:    "Colombo",
        country: "Sri Lanka",
    },
}
fmt.Println(emp.address.city)



Diffreneces of maps and structs:
------------------------------------

🗺️ Map
--------

Key-value pairs where keys are dynamic (you choose them at runtime).

Useful when you don't know the exact field names ahead of time.

Example:

person := map[string]string{
    "name": "Eliana",
    "job": "Engineer",
}


🧱 Struct
----------

A fixed blueprint with known field names (set at compile time).

Useful when you want a strongly-typed, well-defined structure.

Example:

type Person struct {
    name string
    job  string
}

💥 In one line:
----------------

🔑 Use a map when you need flexibility, use a struct when you need structure and type safety.

Let me know if you want a fun side-by-side code comparison too! 😄


Q: cant we add functions inside a struct? like we add methods inside a class in c# or java?

A: ❓ Can we add functions inside a struct in Go?
❌ No, you cannot define functions inside a struct like you do in a class in C# or Java.


🧠 But... how does Go handle this then?
In Go, we add methods to a struct outside the struct, by using something called a receiver.

🔧 Example:

package main

import "fmt"

// 1. Define a struct
type Person struct {
	name string
	age  int
}

// 2. Add a method to Person (outside the struct)
func (p Person) SayHello() {
	fmt.Println("Hi, my name is", p.name, "and I'm", p.age, "years old.")
}

func main() {
	p := Person{name: "Kamal", age: 30}
	p.SayHello() // Calling the method
}

💡 What's going on?
---------------------

func (p Person) SayHello() is a method on the Person struct.

(p Person) is the receiver — this is how Go says “this function belongs to Person”.

It’s similar to writing public void SayHello() inside a class in C#.

🔁 What if I want to modify the struct inside the method?
Use a pointer receiver:

func (p *Person) Birthday() {
	p.age++
}

Now p.age will actually be changed because we're using a pointer.
