ðŸ§  What is go mod init firstgo?
________________________________

This command is saying:

"Hey Go, Iâ€™m starting a new project called firstgo, please set up the basics so I can import stuff later and work like a pro."

ðŸ§° What it does:
-----------------
When you type: " go mod init firstgo "

Go will create a file called:

go.mod

This file is like your projectâ€™s ID card. It tells Go:

What the name of your project is (firstgo)

What dependencies (packages) it should track

What version of Go you're using

ðŸ“¦ Why itâ€™s Important
---------------------

Without this file:

You canâ€™t install or use external packages (like cool libraries)

VS Code might not give you the best IntelliSense/help

Go gets confused when managing your files

ðŸ’¡ Analogy Time
----------------

Think of go mod init firstgo like:

"Creating a folder and telling Go: 'Hey! I'm building something new here, please keep track of everything I use.'"
