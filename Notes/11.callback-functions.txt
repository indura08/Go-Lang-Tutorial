🧠 What is a Callback Function?
_______________________________

A callback function is just a function you pass as an argument to another function, and it gets called back (executed) later inside that function.

Basically:

“Hey, take this function and call it when you’re ready.”

🧪 Example:
------------

package main

import "fmt"

// 🔁 This is the callback function
func greet(name string) {
	fmt.Println("Hello", name)
}

// 🧠 This is the function that takes another function as a parameter
func sayHiLater(callback func(string)) {
	fmt.Println("Doing some stuff first...")
	callback("Eliana")
}

func main() {
	sayHiLater(greet) // Passing 'greet' as a callback
}


🔍 Breakdown:
-------------

greet(name string) is a normal function.

sayHiLater(callback func(string)) means:
👉 "I expect a function that takes a string."

Inside sayHiLater, we call the callback with "Eliana".

The output will be:
