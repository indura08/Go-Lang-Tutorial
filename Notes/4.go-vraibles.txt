🧩 What is a Variable?
=======================

A variable is like a box where you can store something — a number, a piece of text, a value. When you need to use this value later in your code, you can reference the box by its name.

🔑 How do you declare a variable in Go?
=========================================

In Go, variables are declared using the var keyword, followed by the variable name and the type (the kind of value it stores).

EX: 

var age int

age: The name of the variable (think of it as the box's label).

int: The type of the variable (meaning it stores an integer, i.e., whole numbers).

💡 You can also assign a value while declaring a variable.
===========================================================

Example:

var age int = 25

🌟 Shorter Way to Declare and Assign (Using :=)
================================================

If you want to declare and assign a value at the same time without explicitly using var and the type, you can use :=.

Example: age := 25

Go automatically understands that age should be an int because you're assigning it an integer value (25).

📝 Types of Variables in Go
===========================

Go is statically typed, meaning you must specify the type of the variable. Here are some common types:

1. int: For whole numbers (like 25, -3, 1000).

2. float64: For decimal numbers (like 3.14, -1.75).

3. string: For text (like "Hello", "Go is fun!").

4. bool: For true/false values (like true, false).

🚀 Example with Different Types
=================================

var name string = "Alice"  // name is a string
var age int = 30           // age is an int
var height float64 = 5.9   // height is a float64
var isStudent bool = true  // isStudent is a boolean

🏆 Default Values of Variables
===============================

If you declare a variable but don't assign it a value, Go will automatically give it a default value based on its type:

int: 0

float64: 0.0

string: "" (empty string)

bool: false

📝 More Examples
==================

Declare variables and assign later:

var age int
age = 25  // Assigning value after declaration

var name string
name = "Alice"

Declare multiple variables:
You can declare multiple variables in a single line like this:

var x, y int = 10, 20  // x and y are both integers


Declare multiple variables with short declaration :=:
x, y := 10, 20  // both x and y are declared and assigned in one go
